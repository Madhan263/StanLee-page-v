      <p>
        Stan Lee(born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 –
        November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher,
        and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called
        Timely Publications which would later become Marvel Comics' primary
        creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small
        division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that
        dominated the comics and film industries.

        In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists
        Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created characters including
        superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man,
        the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange,
        Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters'
        introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in
        superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of
        the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its
        policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties
        in other media, with mixed results.

        Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public
        figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in
        films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he
        received an executive producer credit. He continued independent creative
        ventures into his 90s until his death in 2018. Lee was inducted into the
        comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the
        Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of
        Arts in 2008.

        Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New
        York City, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant
        parents, Celia (née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th
        Street and West End Avenue.Lee was raised in a Jewish household, and in
        a 2002 interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God, "Well, let
        me put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I'm not going to try to be clever. I
        really don't know. I just don't know."On another interview from 2011,
        when asked about his Romanian origins and his relationship with the
        country, he said that he had never visited it and that he did not know
        Romanian because his parents never taught it to him.Lee's father,
        trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great
        Depression, and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington
        Avenue,in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother
        named Larry Lieber.He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by
        books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic
        roles. By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an
        apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee described it as "a
        third-floor apartment facing out back". Lee and his brother shared the
        bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.
